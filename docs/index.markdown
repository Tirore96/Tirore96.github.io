I pursued my PhD at IT University of Copenhagen with main
supervisor Marco Carbone and co-supervisor Jesper Bengtson.
During my PhD I mechanised subject reduction and communication safety,
based on their formulation in Honda et al. [1]. This was carried out
in the Coq Proof Assistant. Links for developments are provided below.

## Projects with proof assistants
