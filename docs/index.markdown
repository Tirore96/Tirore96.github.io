I am a PhD student at IT University of Copenhagen under supervision of Marco Carbone and Jesper Bengtson. I am part of their Program, Logics and Semantics group (PLS). I am interested in program verification through the use of proof assistants, as well as techniques in general for the analysis and verification of programming languages. I am currently working on a mechanisation of multi party session types, as they were initially formulated [1]. 

## Publications 
* A sound and Complete Projection for Global Types (ITP23)

## Mechanisation projects
* MSc thesis: A Propositional Calculus for Contract Specification (Coq) 
  [pdf](/assets/report.pdf) 
* Verified Rewriting of MFOTL Formulas (Isabelle) [pdf](/assets/mfotl.pdf)
* Soundness and Completeness of Verification Conditions wrt to Hoare Logic (Twelf)
