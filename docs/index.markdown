I pursued my PhD at IT University of Copenhagen with main 
supervisor Marco Carbone and co-supervisor Jesper Bengtson.
During my PhD I mechanised subject reduction and communication safety,
based on their formulation in Honda et al. [1]. This was carried out
in the Coq Proof Assistant. The thesis can be found
[here](/assets/thesis.pdf) and links for developments are provided
below.   

## Open to network
I am interested in formal methods and their use in practice. Having
spent now some years in academia, I now seek a research position in
industry where formal methods are used in practice. Feel free to get
in contact on dawit.tirore@gmail.com
