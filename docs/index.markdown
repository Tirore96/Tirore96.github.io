## Open to network
I am interested in formal methods and their use in practice. Having
spent now some years in academia, I now seek a research position in
industry where formal methods are used in practice. Feel free to get
in contact on dawit.tirore@gmail.com       

I pursued my PhD at IT University of Copenhagen with main 
supervisor Marco Carbone and co-supervisor Jesper Bengtson.
During my PhD I mechanised subject reduction and communication safety,
based on their formulation in Honda et al. [1]. This was carried out
in the Coq Proof Assistant. The thesis can be found
[here](/assets/thesis.pdf) and links for developments are provided
below.  

## Publications 
* (Coq) A sound and Complete Projection for Global Types publised in the
Interactive Theorem Proving conference in 2023
[code](https://github.com/Tirore96/projection) [pdf](/assets/itp.pdf)

## Theses
* MSc thesis: A Propositional Calculus for Contract Specification (Coq) 
  [pdf](/assets/report.pdf) [code](https://github.com/Tirore96/csl_derivatives)
* PhD thesis: A Mechanisation of Multiparty Session Types [pdf](/assets/thesis.pdf)


## Other projects involving proof assistants
* (Isabelle) Verified Rewriting of MFOTL Formulas
  [code](https://github.com/Tirore96/verimon-rewriting) [pdf](/assets/mfotl.pdf)

* (Coq) Subject reduction for multiparty session types (Coq)
