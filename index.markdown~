I am a PhD student at IT University of Copenhagen under supervision of Marco Carbone and Jesper Bengtson. I am part of their Program, Logics and Semantics group (PLS). I am interested in program verification through the use of proof assistants, as well as techniques in general for the analysis and verification of programming languages. So far, the topic of my phd has been the mechanisation of Multi Party Session Types in the Coq proof assistant. 

## Publications 
* A sound and Complete Projection for Global Types (ITP23)

## Mechanisation projects
* A Propositional Calculus for Contract Specification (Coq)
* Verified Rewriting of MFOTL Formulas (Isabelle)
* Soundness and Completeness of Verification Conditions wrt to Hoare Logic (Twelf)
